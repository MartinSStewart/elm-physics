{-| Constraint allows to limit the freedom of movement
of two bodies with relation to each other.

{-| Connect a point on the first body with a point on the second body.
Points are defined within the bodiesâ€™ local coordinate systems.

{-| Keep two bodies connected with each other and limit the freedom of rotation.
Useful for e.g. connecting a window to a window frame, or to connect a wheel to a car.

from each other.
