module ConvexConvex exposing (main)

{- For a useful benchmark,
   copy and rename an older baseline version of Collision/ConvexConvex.elm
   to Collision/OriginalConvexConvex.elm and uncomment the import below,
   then toggle the usage in benchmarks.

   Switching it back to use the (current) ConvexConvex.elm through the
   OriginalConvexConvex alias keeps obsolete or redundant code out of
   the repo while the comparison benchmarks continue to be maintained and
   built and run essentially as absolute non-comparison benchmarks until
   they are needed again in another round of performance work.
